# svt_takehome

run the code:\
python3 takehome-robot.py -l 'loadID' -x 'x-cord' -y 'y-cord'\
example: 'python3 takehome-robot.py -l test -x 50 -y 50'

to install the library used in the code:\
sudo pip3 install requests\
sudo pip3 install json


Further implementation:
when there is 10000 robot and 1000 in the 10 unit range then some sort and search algorithm should be used for improve speed\
loadId is unused but it can contains some info that helps the search\
create a mapper class that store all the info of robot for furture features and functionalities
